INSERT INTO `articles` VALUES (1,'C++ COOL','Every web developer knows what a \"fish\" text is. This text, despite the name, has no relation to the inhabitants of reservoirs. It is used by web designers to insert on Internet pages and demonstrate the appearance of content, view fonts, paragraphs, indents, etc. Since the purpose of using such a text is exclusively demonstrative, it does not necessarily have to carry a semantic load. Moreover, the illegibility of the text will play a role in assessing the quality of the perception of the layout.\n \n  The most famous \"fish\" text is the famous Lorem ipsum. It is believed that it was first used in book printing in the 16th century. Lorem ipsum owes its appearance to the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero, because it was from his treatise \"On the Limits of Good and Evil\" that the medieval book printer extracted individual phrases and words, resulting in the \"fish\" text that is widely used to this day. Of course, there are some questions related to the use of Lorem ipsum on sites and projects focused on Cyrillic content - the writing of symbols in Latin and in Cyrillic differs significantly.\n \n  And even with languages that use the Latin alphabet, small problems may arise: in different languages, certain letters occur with different frequency, there is a difference in the length of the most common words. This leads to the conclusion that it is better to use the text in the language that is planned to be used when the project is launched as a \"fish\". Today, there are several variants of Lorem ipsum, in addition, there are special generators that create their own versions of the text based on the original treatise, which makes it possible to get a longer, unique set of words.',1,0,'2022-12-12 14:12:18'),(2,'What\'s ะก++','On the other hand, the strengthening and development of the structure ensures participation in the formation of systems of mass participation.
