EXERCISE 2

A trainee, for which you are responsible, must retrieve a list of users from a database but also give
the possibility of adding them using a form.

The main script consists of two parts:
● The list of users and their information
● The form for adding a new user

The trainee begins in PHP programming. It does not indent or comment on its code. As an internship
supervisor, you must help him correct and make his code work.
Good indentation of the code is also necessary.

Implementation steps:
1. Download the files at this address: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11gHxkz8fCZTrrIwYzIfnk5kx_anfA2-i?usp=sharing
2. Deploy the files index.php and connect.php on your local server and import the SQL script
users-install.sql. This will create a new database containing a table “users”.
3. Help your trainee to debug his code, correct his errors and make it work.

BONUS : Use a custom Exception to check if the input of the form is valid.
