Dear Hiring Manager

I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Web Developer position that has recently opened up at your esteemed organization. As a graduate of Full Stack Developer courses, I was thrilled to come across your job posting and would like to apply for the role.

My recent experience in web development has shaped my knowledge of writing code for website development. I have a solid understanding of programming languages like JS, PHP, SQL, and modern frameworks such as React and Laravel, which I am confident will help me contribute to the success of your company.

I have had the opportunity to work on a number of web development projects, including developing a website using Bootstrap to teach the Luxembourgish language, prior to enrolling in the Full Stack Developer courses. During my studies, I gained practical experience in creating responsive websites using modern approaches, and I am confident that I can bring this experience to your company.

I am excited about the opportunity to work with your team and contribute to your company's continued success. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this position further with you.

Sincerely,

ARSEN TURELYK
