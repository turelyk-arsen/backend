Given this database structure :

**INSTRUMENTS**(id, name, type, price)

**BANDS**(id, name, bio)

**INSTRUMENTS_IN_BAND**(#band_id, #instrument_id)

You need, in a separate TXT/SQL file, to write the query to:

1. display all the instruments for band ‘Metallica’

SELECT i.id, i.name, i.type, i.price
FROM INSTRUMENTS i
INNER JOIN INSTRUMENTS_IN_BAND ib ON i.id = ib.instrument_id
INNER JOIN BANDS b ON ib.band_id = b.id
WHERE b.name = 'Metallica';

2. For each band, display the name of the band + number of instruments 
used by that band.

SELECT b.name, COUNT(*) AS number_instruments
FROM BANDS b
INNER JOIN INSTRUMENTS_IN_BAND ib ON b.id = ib.band_id
GROUP BY b.id;

Note: Only write only the SQL query, no need for the all PHP.
