creating a registration form, a login form, and storing the user data in a MySQL database.
1.
    Create a database and a table in MySQL: 
    You will need to create a database and a table to store the user's registration data.
    The table should have columns for the user's name, email, password, and any other relevant
    information you want to collect.

2. 
    Create a registration form: Create an HTML form that collects the user's name,
    email, and password. Make sure to use the POST method and submit the form to a PHP script.

3.
    Create a PHP script to process the registration form: Create a PHP script that 
    will validate the user's input and insert it into the MySQL database. 
    You will need to use the mysqli functions to connect to the database and insert the data.

4.
    Create a login form: Create an HTML form that collects the user's email and password.
    Make sure to use the POST method and submit the form to a PHP script.

5.
    Create a PHP script to process the login form: Create a PHP script that will 
    check if the user's email and password match the ones stored in the MySQL database.
    If they match, set a session variable to indicate that the user is logged in.

6.
    Display the user data: Create a PHP script that will display the user's data after
    they log in. You can use the session variable to retrieve the user's data from the MySQL
    database and display it in an HTML table.
